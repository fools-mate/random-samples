# Random Samples
A small Bash script to download random audio files(samples) from the BBC Sound Effects library.

I think it's a cool way to get creative with new samples very quickly.

## Usage:
Download the code and copy random-samples.sh into your folder of choice and run:

    ./random-sample.sh

This will start the script with the default settings.
If the file is not executable, type `chmod +x random-sample.sh` and retry.

If you want, there are two arguments to modify the output.

    ./random-sample.sh new-samples 10
   
This creates a new folder with the name "new-samples" and downloads 10 samples.

## Note:
If you know some good sound libraries that could be implemented or have ideas for improving this tool, 
feel free to send a PR or contact me.

Thank you!
